* Idea

A custom language meant for tech savvy graphic designers who need to design standardized vector graphics for their projects. This would be a langauge similar in functionality to LaTeX with the purpose of compiling to a vector format file like an SVG.

The designer would type out in a plaintext language the commands to create the vector graphics. These commands would then be compiled down to objects in the language and then formated into an SVG file format.
